The game implements similar features to the original Asteroids release.
It spawns a set of asteroids (chosen at random), and after all of them are destroyed,
a new set spawns, continuing the cycle.
Enemies after after a set amount of time (chosen at random) and have 2 different
behaviours: The big ufo follows the player when it's close and shoots randomly. 
The small ufo follows the player from a greater distance and shoots at its location.
We have the posibility of getting a set of lifes for the player (3 at the start,
1 extra life for every 10000 points acquired), which are displayed in a UI as well
as the current points.
The player can move, shoot and travel to hyperspace (where it has a chance of being 
automatically destroyed, just like in the arcade game), spawning at a new random 
location on the screen.
Pending additions to the project include:
-Score saving
-Visual Particle Effects
-Additional sounds
-Additional player stat modifications from powerups.
-Implement different visual filters from a settings menu.
